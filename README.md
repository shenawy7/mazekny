Our App is going to be called Mazekny, and as you can imagine from the name it is an app that connect musicians together. For example, if I have a band and we are missing a drummer, I can download Mazekny and register the band, then I can filter my search of musicians to drummer near me, or by professional level. This is a problem that a lot of musicianâ€™s face when they are starting their careers, and that is why we thought of this idea, that will make it easier to find band members or individuals that you want to work with on producing music. Mazekny will have a simple algorithm that connects musicians together based on the filters that are applied by both parties, that can be geographically and by the expert level. After we thought about the idea, we thought that we do not just want people to download our app and once they connect with a musician delete the app, so we are going to develop an online store inside the app that is special for renting, buying, and selling instruments and other music equipment. This online shop can be individuals that want to rent, buy, or sell instruments, or shops that would like to show their instruments on the Mazekny store. Our final feature that we wanted to incorporate in our app is a problem that musicians in Egypt run into a lot, which is finding a good music studio around them, so our app will show you all the near studio locations, with their contact information to book a time slot from their end. Our idea is to help musicians start their careers and provide them with as much help as we can, we are also going to offer a premium of our app that can make the users be displayed in the beginning of any search if they are in the same category. Also, our plan is to put ads on our app that music related industries or businesses would like to advertise for their product on our app.
